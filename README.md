# Application Framework Assignment by Ismael Amarochi for David van Steertegem

I've had a lot of issues with maven. I've had multiple projects for this assignment but i have gathered all the info into this project. Everything should be working.

In order to see the correct code please navigate to the `after_maven_fix` branch.

I've had problems implementing the login, i succesfully added a Google OAuth system. Since the login does not work the admin panel is not accessible through the website.
The configurtion can be edited in order to access the admin related views. The DB is seeded so the site is fully functioning.
